Hello I want to say thank you for the opportunity and it was a fun assignment to work on,

Firstly i have used inbuilt H2 Database for backend Java

So to start we need to change one file first in the backend 

"EmployeeServiceImpl".java" on line 31. Have to change the filepath to the filepath you are accesing the files from.

After that you may proceed to upload file, it will save into the database calling the "/users/upload" API.

API List
============

/users/upload - to upload files
/users/ - to do pagination and sort for Employee
/users/getAll - to get all Employees
/users/add - to add a new Employee
/users/update - to update Existing Employee
/users/delete/{id} - to delet existing Employee

After starting the backend, you may proceed to start frontend toppan file, with a ng serve command.

Please feel free to text me if there's any questions 90107247
